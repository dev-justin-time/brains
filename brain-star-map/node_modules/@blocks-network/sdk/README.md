# @blocks-network/sdk

Blocks Network SDK for Node.js

## Installation

```bash
npm install @blocks-network/sdk
```

## Quick Start

Create a `handler.ts` file:

```typescript
import type { TaskContext } from '@blocks-network/sdk';

export default async function handler(task: any, ctx: TaskContext) {
  const input = task.requestParts?.[0]?.text ?? '';
  ctx.reportStatus(`Processing: ${input}`);
  return { artifacts: [{ data: `Echo: ${input}`, mimeType: 'text/plain' }] };
}
```

Create an `agent-card.json`:

```json
{
  "identity": {
    "agentName": "my_agent",
    "displayName": "My Agent",
    "description": "An example agent",
    "version": "1.0.0",
    "provider": { "organization": "Your Org" }
  },
  "capabilities": { "taskKinds": ["request"] },
  "tags": [{ "id": "main", "name": "Main" }],
  "runtime": {
    "handler": "./handler.ts"
  }
}
```

## Running Agents

The canonical way to run an agent is via the
[Blocks CLI](../../cli/README.md):

```bash
blocks run
```

This validates `agent-card.json`, loads `.env`, and starts the agent
runtime. The CLI delegates to the SDK's `blocks-run` binary under the
hood.

For direct invocation without the CLI:

```bash
npx blocks-run
```

Both approaches load environment variables from `.env` in the current
working directory. Run `blocks login --write-env` first to populate `BLOCKS_API_KEY`.

## agent-card.json

The agent card follows the A2A specification with a `runtime` extension:

```json
{
  "identity": {
    "agentName": "my_agent",
    "displayName": "My Agent",
    "description": "An example agent",
    "version": "1.0.0",
    "provider": { "organization": "Your Org" }
  },
  "capabilities": { "taskKinds": ["request"] },
  "tags": [{ "id": "main", "name": "Main" }],
  "runtime": {
    "handler": "./handler.ts",
    "handlerExport": "default",
    "concurrency": 1
  }
}
```

Note: `identity.agentName` must use only alphanumeric characters and
underscores (no hyphens). The pattern is `^[a-zA-Z0-9_]+$`.

## Subscribe Strategy

The SDK keeps the control client subscribed for the agent's lifetime
and configures the underlying realtime transport to retry indefinitely
on transient failures. The agent therefore resumes within seconds of a
network outage ending without any manual intervention.

Connectivity-state changes are surfaced through the SDK log:

- `event: 'transport_degraded'` (warn) — emitted when the transport
  reports network down, network issues, timeout, or a malformed
  response. The log line reads `connectivity degraded: <category>`,
  where `<category>` is one of `network_down`, `network_issues`,
  `timeout`, `malformed_response`.
- `event: 'transport_restored'` (info) — emitted on reconnection.

Per-task and per-stream clients keep the default short retry budget.
They are short-lived; a stuck task should fail cleanly rather than
loop forever.

## API

### `await startAgentInstance(options)`

Start an agent instance with full control over configuration. This is
the primary runtime API.

## Authentication

The SDK reads `BLOCKS_API_KEY` from the environment and uses it to
authenticate with the backend. Set this in your `.env` file. The
Go CLI's `blocks login` command writes the API key to `.env` when
invoked with `--write-env` (or by answering "y" to its interactive
prompt).

Access tokens for realtime channel access are managed by the SDK at runtime
(granted at registration, refreshed per-task on the control channel).
No CLI involvement is needed for token management.

### Logging

The SDK respects two log-related environment variables:

- `LOG_LEVEL` (default: `info`) — `error` | `warn` | `info` | `debug`. Threshold for the SDK's own log lines (`[AgentInstance]`, `[Transport]`).
- `BLOCKS_DEBUG_INTERNAL` (default: unset) — comma-separated list of subsystems to enable. Neither subsystem is implied by `LOG_LEVEL=debug`.
  - `diagnostics` — Blocks-authored transport-connectivity diagnostics (connection-state transitions, alive snapshots).
  - `forward_transport` — routes the underlying transport's own log output through the Blocks logger with a `[Transport]` prefix, filtered by `LOG_LEVEL`. Off by default because the forwarded messages reference internal SDK config concepts that aren't meaningful to a Blocks developer. **Security note:** forwarded entries may include constructed transport URLs whose query strings carry the access-token (`auth=…`) or request-signature (`signature=…`) parameters. Do not enable in environments that ship logs to less-trusted sinks (third-party log shippers, public Sentry projects, support-ticket attachments).
  - Example: `BLOCKS_DEBUG_INTERNAL=diagnostics,forward_transport`

## Examples

For complete, runnable example agents, see the
[Node examples](../../examples/node/README.md). Examples cover
request/response, streaming, orchestration, pipe tasks, and advanced
wrapper patterns.

## Consumer API

The SDK provides a consumer-side API for submitting tasks, connecting to
existing tasks, handling events, and downloading artifacts.

### `TaskClient.create(options)`

Static async factory that creates a configured `TaskClient` from
environment variables or CDM config.

```typescript
const client = await TaskClient.create({ billingMode: 'free' });
```

- `billingMode` (required): `'free'` or `'paid'`. Selects the keyset — `'free'` → playground, `'paid'` → network. Must match the target agent's persisted `billingMode`, which is set explicitly by the agent owner at register/update time (the backend validates pricing against `billingMode` — `'free'` rejects positive prices, `'paid'` requires a positive `pricePerTask` or `pricePerMinute` — but does NOT derive `billingMode` from pricing). The backend rejects mismatches between the caller-supplied `billingMode` and the agent row with `BillingModeMismatch`.
- Resolution: explicit options > `BLOCKS_*` env vars > CDM config
- Auth: one of the token provider modes below

### Token Provider Modes

`TaskClient.create()` supports three token provider modes for automatic
token acquisition and refresh.

**Mode 1: API key (server-side)**

```typescript
const client = await TaskClient.create({
  billingMode: 'free',
  apiKey: process.env.BLOCKS_API_KEY,
  onAuthError: (err) => console.error('Auth failed:', err.message),
});
```

The SDK exchanges the API key for a short-lived JWT via
`POST /api/v1/auth/agent/consumer-token` and refreshes it
automatically at 80% of its TTL. Use this for backend services, scripts,
and cron jobs.

**Mode 2: Token endpoint (client-side proxy)**

Simplest form — a bare URL string. The SDK sends `POST <url>` with
`Content-Type: application/json` and body `{}`:

```typescript
const client = await TaskClient.create({
  billingMode: 'free',
  tokenEndpoint: '/api/blocks-token',
});
```

Config-object form — pass a `TokenEndpointConfig` when your proxy
needs cookies, custom headers, or a non-empty request body. Every
field is optional except `url`:

```typescript
import type { TokenEndpointConfig } from '@blocks-network/sdk';

const tokenEndpoint: TokenEndpointConfig = {
  url: '/api/blocks-token',
  credentials: 'include', // send session cookies
  headers: { 'X-CSRF-Token': readCsrfMeta() }, // merged with Content-Type
  body: { sessionId: getCurrentSessionId() }, // replaces the default {}
};

const client = await TaskClient.create({
  billingMode: 'free',
  tokenEndpoint,
});
```

`credentials` accepts any of `'include' | 'same-origin' | 'omit'`
(matches `fetch`'s `RequestCredentials`). User-supplied `headers`
merge on top of the SDK default `Content-Type: application/json`
(user values win). `body` is JSON-serialized and replaces the default
empty-object body. The same config is used for both the initial
token acquisition and subsequent refreshes.

The SDK sends POST requests whenever it needs a token. The endpoint
identifies the caller, mints a Blocks consumer JWT, and returns
`{ token, expiresIn, userId }`. The endpoint must include `userId`
so `client.getUserId()` works. No long-lived credential ever reaches
the client.

`tokenEndpoint` has two first-class deployment shapes:

1. **Customer-owned backend proxy.** Your own service holds the
   Blocks API key, authenticates the browser caller however you
   choose (session cookie / OAuth / etc.), and forwards to the
   Blocks backend's `POST /api/v1/auth/agent/consumer-token`.
2. **Dashboard embedder.** The Blocks backend's own
   `POST /api/v1/auth/agent/consumer-token` endpoint, called directly
   from a signed-in dashboard with the user's session cookie plus
   `X-Active-Org` and `X-CSRF-Token` headers. No proxy, no API key in
   the browser. Custom apps usually use the customer-owned backend
   proxy shape.

Both shapes speak the same Mode 2 contract and are consumed
uniformly by this SDK.

> **Node/Python asymmetry.** `credentials` is Node-only because Python's
> `urllib.request` has no equivalent of `fetch`'s credentials mode.
> Python consumers pass cookies explicitly via
> `headers={'Cookie': 'session=...'}`. See the
> [Python README](../python/README.md) for the parity recipe.

**Mode 3: Custom function**

```typescript
const client = await TaskClient.create({
  billingMode: 'free',
  tokenProvider: async () => {
    const resp = await fetch('/api/my-auth');
    const { token, expiresIn, userId } = await resp.json();
    return { token, expiresIn, userId };
  },
});
```

For OAuth2, custom SSO, or any auth architecture. The function is
called on init and before each expiry.

**Refresh and error handling**

All modes refresh proactively at 80% TTL and reactively on HTTP 401.
On 3 consecutive failures, `onAuthError` fires. The stale token
remains usable until the next 401. `client.destroy()` stops the
refresh timer but does not invalidate the current token.

`ownerId` is auto-populated from the authenticated identity when
omitted. Explicit `ownerId` still works and overrides the default.
The backend rejects mismatches between `ownerId` and the
authenticated identity.

### `client.connect({ taskId })`

Connect to an existing task. Returns a `TaskSession` pre-populated with
stream refs, artifact refs, and task state from history.

```typescript
const session = await client.connect({ taskId: 'task-abc-123' });
```

- Requires an authenticated `TaskClient` (for example one created with
  `apiKey`, `tokenEndpoint`, or `tokenProvider`). Fails with a clear
  error if not set.
- Terminal tasks: session is not subscribed, read state via
  `listArtifacts()` and `session.state`.
- Active tasks: session subscribes, live events flow through callbacks.

### `session.listArtifacts()`

Returns all `ArtifactRef` instances seen so far (from history and live
events).

```typescript
const artifacts: ArtifactRef[] = session.listArtifacts();
```

### `session.downloadArtifact(ref)`

Download an artifact. Handles inline (base64) and file-backed artifacts
transparently.

```typescript
const result: DownloadedArtifact = await session.downloadArtifact(ref);
// result.data: Uint8Array, result.mimeType: string, result.fileName?: string
```

Also available as a standalone function: `downloadArtifact(ref, pubnub)`.

### `session.onError(cb)`

Register a handler for callback errors. Returns an `Unsubscribe`
function.

```typescript
const unsub = session.onError((error, context) => {
  console.error(`Error in ${context.callbackType}:`, error.message);
});
```

`CallbackErrorContext` includes `entryPoint`, `callbackType`, and
`event`. Without `onError` handlers, callback errors are logged at warn
level.

### `session.waitForTerminal(timeoutMs?)`

Wait for a terminal event. Returns a `Promise<TerminalEvent>`. Resolves
immediately for already-terminal sessions (pre-closed idempotent hits,
terminal `connect()`).

```typescript
import { TaskClient, textPart } from '@blocks-network/sdk';

const client = await TaskClient.create({ billingMode: 'free', apiKey });
const session = await client.sendMessage({
  agentName: 'acme_echo',
  requestParts: [textPart('Hello')],
});
// ownerId auto-populated from auth
session.onProgress((e) => console.log(e.message));
const terminal = await session.waitForTerminal(60_000);
console.log('Completed:', terminal.state);
await session.saveArtifacts('./artifacts');
session.close();
client.destroy();
```

### `session.saveArtifacts(dir)`

Download all accumulated artifacts to a directory. Creates the directory
if it does not exist. Returns `Promise<string[]>` of written file paths.

### `client.getAgentCard(agentName)`

Fetch an agent's card from the registry. Returns `Promise<AgentCard | null>`.

### Part Helpers

```typescript
import { textPart, filePart, filePartFromPath } from '@blocks-network/sdk';

const parts = [
  textPart('Hello'),

  // Universal, browser-safe — accepts Uint8Array, ArrayBuffer, Blob, File:
  filePart(new Uint8Array([1, 2, 3]), { fileName: 'raw.bin' }),

  // Browser consumers hand a File straight from <input type="file">:
  //   filePart(fileInput.files[0]),
  // Blob works too:
  //   filePart(new Blob([bytes], { type: 'image/png' })),

  // Node-only — reads from disk via a lazy `node:fs` import (async):
  await filePartFromPath('./data.csv'),
];
```

`filePart` is synchronous and has no `node:fs` dependency, so the
package is safe to import from browser bundles. The legacy
`filePart('./path')` signature is gone — path-based construction
now lives on `filePartFromPath`, which bundlers targeting `browser`
will error on because of the lazy `node:fs` import. `Buffer` values
continue to work as `filePart` input at runtime because `Buffer`
extends `Uint8Array`.

### Stream Consumer APIs

All consumer iterators (`bytes()`, `events()`, `readable()`, `inbound`) deliver messages in sequence order. The SDK's reorder buffer transparently corrects out-of-order delivery and drops duplicate messages. To customize or disable reordering, pass `reorderTimeoutMs` to `open()`:

```typescript
// Default: reorder buffer with 750ms gap timeout
const stream = ref.open();

// Custom timeout
const stream = ref.open({ reorderTimeoutMs: 2000 });

// Disable reordering (legacy arrival-order passthrough)
const stream = ref.open({ reorderTimeoutMs: 0 });
```

```typescript
// Decoded byte iterator (yields Uint8Array, browser-safe)
for await (const chunk of stream.bytes()) {
  process.stdout.write(chunk); // Node
}

// Same iterator, browser-friendly text decoding
const decoder = new TextDecoder();
let text = '';
for await (const chunk of stream.bytes()) {
  text += decoder.decode(chunk, { stream: true });
}

// Flattened event iterator (browser-safe)
for await (const event of stream.events<MyEventType>()) {
  console.log(event);
}

// Node-only: Readable adapter for pipe() integration. Do not call
// in browser bundles — returns a Node.js `Readable`.
const readable = await stream.readable();
readable.pipe(createWriteStream('./output.bin'));
```

### Handling Stream Errors

Every `StreamClient` exposes an `onError(cb)` registration method.
The callback fires whenever the stream's subscribe loop surfaces an
error-category status event: access revocation, network issues,
timeouts, or any other transport error category. The payload is a
typed `StreamError`:

```typescript
import type { StreamError } from '@blocks-network/sdk/stream';

const stream = ref.open();
stream.onError((err: StreamError) => {
  console.warn(`[stream] ${err.category} fatal=${err.fatal} channel=${err.channel}`);
});

for await (const chunk of stream.bytes()) {
  process.stdout.write(chunk);
}
```

Two categories are **fatal** and cause the SDK to force-terminate
the stream so `for await` / `for msg in ...` loops exit cleanly
instead of hanging waiting for a `stream_end` that will never
arrive:

- `access_denied` — access grant revoked (admin-terminate or
  token denied). This is the signal that the server-side grant is
  gone even if the cached token's `exp` claim has not elapsed.
- `bad_request` — auth configuration or malformed grant.

All other error categories (`network_down`, `network_issues`,
`timeout`, `malformed_response`, `other`) fire `onError` with
`fatal: false` and leave the stream running so the transport's
built-in retry machinery can recover.

### Opening Task Streams

On an active task, `StreamRef.open()` is the standard way to
subscribe to a stream. Use `onStream((ref) => { const s = ref.open(); ... })`
to open streams reactively as they are announced, or call
`session.openAllStreams()` once to open every readable stream in one
shot:

```typescript
import { TaskClient, textPart } from '@blocks-network/sdk';

const session = await client.sendMessage({
  agentName: 'multi_stream_agent',
  requestParts: [textPart('start')],
  stream: true, // request-task streaming is opt-in (BLOCKS-181)
});

// Option 1 — react to each stream as it is announced
session.onStream((ref) => {
  const stream = ref.open();
  void consume(stream, ref.descriptor.declaredStream);
});

// Option 2 — open every readable stream in one call, then branch
await session.waitForStream(); // ensure at least one is announced
const streams = session.openAllStreams(); // returns StreamClient[] in insertion order
for (const s of streams) {
  void consume(s /* whichever ref you care about */);
}
```

`openAllStreams()` is idempotent. Calling it again returns the same
`StreamClient` objects for already-opened refs and skips outbound-only
streams. It is an **active-session** convenience — it does not
resurrect unopened streams after terminal; see the next section.

**Drain window for already-open streams.** When the task reaches
terminal, any stream that was already opened continues draining
cleanly for up to **30 seconds** (raised from 2 seconds in prior
versions) so consumers have time to finish iterating `for await`
loops. Tune the window per session:

```typescript
// Narrower window for fast-shutdown flows
const session = await client.sendMessage({
  agentName: 'llm_streamer',
  requestParts: [textPart('stream please')],
  stream: true,         // request-task streaming is opt-in (BLOCKS-181)
  drainWindowMs: 5_000, // 5 seconds
});

// Wider window for long-tail consumers, or on connect()
const resumed = await client.connect({
  taskId: 'task-abc',
  drainWindowMs: 60_000, // 60 seconds
});
```

The option is supported on both `sendMessage()` and `connect()`.

### Reconnecting to Terminal Tasks

Stream data is **live-only** — the realtime transport does not persist
stream payloads. When `client.connect({ taskId })` returns a session for a
task that has already finished, a stream that was **never opened
while the task was active** throws a typed `StreamUnavailableError`
from `StreamRef.open()` instead of subscribing to a dead channel.
`openAllStreams()` on the same session silently skips those
never-opened refs:

```typescript
import { TaskClient, StreamUnavailableError } from '@blocks-network/sdk';

const session = await client.connect({ taskId: 'task-abc-123' });

for (const ref of session.listStreams()) {
  try {
    const stream = ref.open();
    // ... consume stream ...
  } catch (err) {
    if (err instanceof StreamUnavailableError) {
      // Stream data is gone, but descriptor and artifacts remain:
      console.log('stream', ref.descriptor.declaredStream, err.terminalState);
    } else {
      throw err;
    }
  }
}

// Artifacts produced by the finished task are still available:
const artifacts = session.listArtifacts();
await session.saveArtifacts('./recovered');
```

`StreamUnavailableError` carries named fields `taskId`, `streamId`,
`declaredStream`, and `terminalState`. Inspection of
`ref.descriptor` (format, metadata, declared name) continues to
work on terminal-session refs without raising.

> `openAllStreams()` is **not** a post-terminal reopen escape hatch.
> If you want every stream opened, call it while the task is still
> active (for example immediately after `session.waitForStream()` or
> inside an `onStream` callback). On a terminal session it silently
> returns any streams that were already active and skips the rest.

### Resource Management

```typescript
// TypeScript 5.2+ using keyword
{
  using client = await TaskClient.create({ billingMode: 'free', apiKey });
  // client.destroy() called automatically at scope exit
}

{
  await using session = await client.sendMessage({ ... });
  // session.asyncClose() called automatically at scope exit
}
```

## Browser Support

The SDK works in modern browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge).
Import from the package root — no special browser entrypoint needed:

    import { TaskClient, TaskSession, StreamRef } from '@blocks-network/sdk';

The Node SDK package.json declares `engines.node >= 22.0.0` (Node 22
Maintenance LTS) alongside the `browser` exports field. Node 22+ has native
`FormData`, `fetch`, `Blob`, `Uint8Array`, `TextEncoder`, and
`TextDecoder`, which the SDK uses directly — no polyfill required on
either platform. CI tests against Node 22, 24, and 26.

**Consumer APIs** (TaskClient, TaskSession, StreamRef, StreamClient)
are browser-safe — no Node.js `Buffer` polyfill needed:

- `sendMessage()` accepts `Uint8Array`, `ArrayBuffer`, `Blob`, and
  `File` on `requestParts[].file`. Hand a `File` from
  `<input type="file">` straight to `filePart(file)`; hand a `Blob`
  from `fetch('/somewhere').blob()` straight to `filePart(blob)`.
- `uploadToStorage` (large-file path) uses native `FormData` with a
  `Blob` field. `fetch` computes the multipart boundary
  automatically — no manual `Content-Type: multipart/form-data`
  header, no `Buffer.concat`.
- `downloadArtifact()` handles the three download shapes returned by
  the transport (raw `Uint8Array`, `Blob`, and legacy file object with
  `toArrayBuffer()`) with typeof-guarded branches — no
  `Buffer.isBuffer` OR-order short-circuits.
- `decodeInlineArtifact()` uses `atob` + `Uint8Array` and
  round-trips through `bytesToBase64` on encode, so inline artifacts
  decode correctly in browsers even though `Buffer` is not defined.
- `filePart(data)` is synchronous and browser-safe; the file-path
  convenience lives on the Node-only async `filePartFromPath(path)`
  helper.
- `stream.bytes()` yields `Uint8Array` chunks (decoded via
  `TextEncoder` / `atob`, no `Buffer.from`). Decode to text with
  `new TextDecoder().decode(chunk)`. `stream.events()` and
  `stream.inbound` are also browser-safe. **`stream.readable()`
  returns a Node.js `Readable` and is Node-only** — browser
  consumers should use `stream.bytes()` or `stream.inbound` instead.

A jsdom-driven CI test (`tests/browser-execution.test.ts`) exercises
the consumer paths end-to-end so browser regressions are caught
before release. The bundle-smoke test (`tests/browser-bundle.test.ts`)
continues to guard against accidental top-level `node:*` imports.

**Provider APIs** (startAgentInstance) work in browsers for
request-only, short-lived handlers but are not officially supported.
Browser tab lifecycle (sleep, close, background throttling) makes
long-lived agents unreliable.

### Configuration

In browsers, use a customer-owned proxy endpoint or custom provider —
the SDK does not read from `process.env` in browser environments:

    const client = await TaskClient.create({
      billingMode: 'free',
      tokenEndpoint: {
        url: '/api/blocks-token',
        credentials: 'include',     // send the app's session cookie
      },
    });
